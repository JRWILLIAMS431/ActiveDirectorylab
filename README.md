<h2>1. Create DC-1 and Client-1<h2>

</p>
<p>
To begin, we are creating virtual machines through Azure for both DC1 and Client1 that will serve as the sandbox for the entire lab. Be sure to confirm that the virtual network is identical for both of the machines.

<h2>2. Ping DC<h2>

</p>
<p>
Now that both virtual machines are created we are going to open up the command line and attempt to ping DC1 from the client machine. This attempt will inevitably fail. Why? The (Internet Control Message Protocol) ICMP for our DC is disabled and needs to be enabled. Navigate to the windows defender firewall, choose the inbound rules, filter for protocol and find the core diagnostics networking echo. enable it and check the ping again from the client machine. The ping should no longer time out.

<h2>3. Setup Active Directory<h2>

</p>
<p>
After that we will setup and install Active Directory from the DC and set the domain. Open the task manager if it is not already open. Click the add roles and features option and begin the installation of Active Directory including its' extension files. During this process you will be asked to create a domain name for this network of users you are preparing to create.

<h2>4. Create Jane Doe Admin</h2>

</p>
<p>
At this point we are prepared to setup ADMIN and EMPLOYEE users/groups. Through the task manager navigate to the active directory users and computers option. Under your domain create two groups; one for ADMIN and another for EMPLOYEES. In the ADMIN group create a new user, this user is going to be Jane Doe.

<h2>5. Login as Jane Doe</h2>
